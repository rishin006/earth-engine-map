Water scarcity analysis

Calculating Water Scarcity Index using Satellite Images in Google Earth Engine using JavaScript Water scarcity index has calculated for 4 years(2019 to 2022) for 4 seasons(Monsoon,Post monsoon,winter,summer) This has been done by calculating NDVI(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDSI((Normalized Difference Soil Moisture Index) for all the images and Created a Water Scarcity Index(WSI) Formula from that by Assigning Weights. User can select a season and can select any point on the study area and it will display the Water scarcity index of that point and a chart will display the trend of WSI of that point in that season for all 4 years This Visualization has been Published as an App in Google earth engine.
